## REPORT

The challenge was developed using React and Typescript.

I used React hooks for a functional programming pattern. I also followed the container pattern as a file structure to organise containers and presentational components. Normally in a real world scenario the container is where you might fetch the data from an API or talk to Redux if it was being used but I decided to use it anyways if the data was being locally mocked.

I picked Ant Design as a component library and used their Date range picker to create the calendar and date picker.

Also used styled components to achieve the look and feel of the UI and created a CommonStyles file to reuse some styles. The UI is adaptive to the users viewport and I used a combination of Flexbox and CSS grid to get the correct design.
