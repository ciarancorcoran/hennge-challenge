## Improvements

Possible improvements to make to the UI:

- Add a word search bar so as to not limit search to dates
- Lazy loading or pagination could be added if there were a lot of results (could also be used to improve performance).
- Hovering over or clicking on the badge might display the truncated emails
- Functionality for a user to be able to resize the width of each column in the desktop view
- Add folder functionality to possibly group emails or to tag them
